# sudokuSolver
This a simple python code to solve sudoku from an  9x9 entry matrix

This is not complete! It is still in progress to be improved.

Run and enter manually the grid using 0 for blank

 python3 sudoku.py 


N.B. The TensorFlow_yolov4_Tiny  folder contains files and documentation 
     to enter the sudoku grid via a webcam.

     Update. Inside the TensorFlow_yolov4_Tiny folder I added Ali Assaf sudoku solver.
